hey

TODO: any page links up-only (and not down) in the hierarchy needs to turn into "./uppage"

The fact that this does not work is clearly a bug...

[[../index]] (up)

[[level1a]] (self)

[[level1a/level2]] down

[[level1a/level2/level3a]]

[[level1a/level2/level3a/level4a]]

[[level1b]]

[[level1b/level2]]

[[local:thing.py]] (up)

{{local:level1.png}} (up)

[[local:level1a/level2/thingdeep.py]] down

{{local:level1a/level2.png}} down
