Three things:

# A clean bootstrap documentation-like wiki HTML template
Notably, this is the only of the ZimWiki export templates that actually has a navbar ToC for both the page hierarchy AND the in-page headers.

# A zimwiki to vimwiki conversion script
I'm working on adding extra path processing functionality to zim, such that with markdown, it could operate on vimwiki markdown-style notebooks (not present in this repo).

# A demonstration of a bug in HTML export for ZimWiki 
Backlinks to index are absolute, but should be relative.
